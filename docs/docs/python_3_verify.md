# Verifying The Python Version

Python 3.10 or greater is required before installing and using the 
_telemetrix-rpi-pico-2w_ package.

To check that you have the correct version of Python 3 installed,
open a command window and type:

```
python -V
```

Executing this command displays the current version of Python 3 installed.

```
Python 3.13.7
```

If you need to install Python 3, refer to [python.org.](https://www.python.org/)
