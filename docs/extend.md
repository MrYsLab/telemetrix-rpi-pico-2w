Telemetrix was designed to be user extensible. However, you must understand
its inner workings before extending its functionality.

There is a [five-part series](https://mryslab.github.io/bits-n-bots/2025/05/20/telemetrix-under-the-hood--part-1/) 
describing Telemetrix's inner workings. Although the articles refer to the Arduino R4 Uno,
the Telemetrix design is generic enough that the blog posts should provide 
the understanding you need to extend both the clients and servers.
